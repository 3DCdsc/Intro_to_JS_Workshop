      <p>The<span class="animal"> cat</span> is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic <span class="animal">cat</span> to distinguish it from the wild members of the family. A <span class="animal">cat</span> can either be a house <span class="animal">cat</span>, a farm <span class="animal">cat</span> or a feral <span class="animal">cat</span>; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic <span class="animal">cat</span> are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt rodents. About 60 <span class="animal">cat</span> breeds are recognized by various <span class="animal">cat</span> registries. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat">Read more on Wikipedia</a>.</p>
